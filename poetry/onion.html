        <h1>On the Compositional Inverse of the Square-Root Function</h1>

        <p>
          I open my grandmother's cookbook,<br>
          Pages stained with turmeric,<br>
          And the scent of old.<br><br>
        
          I follow her instructions,<br>
          Measure by measure,<br>
          As though she might be watching.<br><br>
          
          I peel the papery skins<br>
          Of the onions for my soup,<br>
          Counting each layer I remove.<br><br>
          
          My knife divides them—<br>
          Halving, quartering, cutting to eighths—<br>
          And the air stings my eyes.<br><br>
          
          The pieces gather in the pot,<br
          Where butter melts slowly,<br>
          Golden and patient,<br>
          Just as she wrote.<br><br>
          
          But somewhere among<br>
          The chopping and the simmering,<br>
Somewhere among<br>
The counting and the dividing,<br>
Somehow, by mistake,<br>
I take<br>
The square root of an onion.<br><br>

On the counter rests<br>
A strange remnant,<br>
Pungent in its incompleteness:<br>
Less than a whole,<br>
Yet more than nothing—<br>
A something without a name.<br><br>

I wonder<br>
If another square-rooted onion,<br>
Multiplied by this one,<br>
Would bring back the whole<br>
She would’ve put into the soup.<br>
