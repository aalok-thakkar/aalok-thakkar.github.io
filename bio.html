					I enjoy listening to Carnatic music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnKy8mh9Hk4">Here</a> is my TEDx talk on the Melakarta system. I learned some history, socio-politics, and theory of Carnatic music through the course <a href="./iart.html">Indian Art in Context</a>. I am curating a catalog of Carnatic pieces on Spotify <a href="./carnatic_playlists_alphabetical.html">here</a>

					During my undergraduate years, I was actively involved in quizzing. <a href="">Here</a> are some of my quizzes from 2017 and 2018. Abhishek Nanoty was my partner in crime for creating and hosting these <em>punderful</em> quizzes.
