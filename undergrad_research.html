          I am pleased to offer the following research projects for motivated
          undergraduate students. These projects provide an excellent
          opportunity to gain hands-on research experience, develop new skills,
          and make meaningful contributions to the field of computer science:

          <span class="bold-text"> query synthesis:</span> This line of work
          aims to extend my previous work on example-guided synthesis of
          relational queries to handle expressive aggregation functions (such as
          SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX) which are essential for querying real world
          databases. The core challenge is to infer user intent from a small set
          of input-output examples and not require additional supervision. If
          interested, please read

          paper as a starting point. <br />
          <br />
          <span class="bold-text"> reasoning in AI:</span> A starting point in
          this direction is to develop an automated solver for
          <a href="https://philosophy.hku.hk/think/logic/knights.php"
            >knights and knaves puzzles</a
          >. We create a system where Large Language Models (LLMs) translate
          puzzles into propositional logic constraints, which are then solved
          using Z3, a theorem prover. This project demonstrates practical
          applications of logical reasoning in AI.
          <a href="./teaching/slaps2024/slaps2024.html">Symbolic Logic</a>
          (CS-2160/2260) is a prerequisite for this project, which I will be
          teaching in the Monsoon 2024 semester. <br />
          <br />
          <span class="bold-text"> poetry generation:</span> Despite their
          impressive text generation capabilities, LLMs face challenges in
          consistently maintaining syntactic requirements such as word and
          syllable counts and positional constraints. An undergraduate project
          in this direction can develop and test methods for improving LLMs'
          ability to generate structurally sound poetry. A starting point for
          this topic is the paper
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.17205">Verse by Verse</a> and its
          accompanying
          <a href="https://sites.research.google/versebyverse/">tool.</a><br />
          <br />
          <span class="bold-text"> learning technologies:</span> This project
          focuses on developing a course-specific AI tutor using LLMs for
          undergraduate computer science courses. The primary objectives are to
          fine-tune an open-source LLM on course materials, implement effective
          prompt engineering techniques, and design interaction patterns that
          promote learning. Key technical challenges include domain-specific
          knowledge integration, handling code-related queries, and balancing
          hint generation with direct answer avoidance. The project will explore
          techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation, few-shot learning,
          and constrained decoding to create an AI assistant that accurately
          explains concepts, provides guided hints, and answers course-related
          questions while adhering to pedagogical principles. <br />
          <br />
          <span class="bold-text"> automated verification:</span> I am also
          interested in automated verification of three critical Indian systems:
          UPI (Unified Payments Interface), EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines),
          and Aadhaar (the national biometric ID system). The goal is to develop
          formal methods and tools to rigorously verify the correctness,
          security, and privacy properties of these systems to enhance public
          trust, identify potential vulnerabilities, and contribute to the
          overall reliability of India's digital infrastructure.<br />
          <br />
          <span class="bold-text"> other:</span> I am interested in theoretical
          computer science at large, including topics such as automata theory,
          formal language theory, formal methods, logic, and programming
          languages, particularly in their applications to program synthesis,
          automated verification, and artificial intelligence. Contact me if you
          would like to pursue a project in these areas.
