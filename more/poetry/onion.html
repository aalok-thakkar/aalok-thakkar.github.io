        <p style="margin: 80px;">
          I open my grandmother's cookbook,<br>
          And follow her instructions,<br>
          Measure by measure.<br><br>

          I peel the papery skins<br>
          Of the onions for my soup,<br>
          Counting each layer I remove.<br><br>
          
          My knife divides them—<br>
          Halving, quartering, cutting to eighths—<br>
          And the air stings my eyes.<br><br>
          
          The pieces gather in the pot,<br>
          Where butter melts slowly,<br>
          Golden and patient,<br>
          Just as she wrote.<br><br>
          
          But somewhere among<br>
          The chopping and the simmering,<br>
          Somewhere among<br>
          The counting and the dividing,<br>
          Somehow, by mistake,<br>
          I take<br>
          The square root of an onion.<br><br>
          
          On the counter rests<br>
          A strange remnant,<br>
          Pungent in its incompleteness:<br>
          Less than a whole,<br>
          Yet more than nothing—<br>
          A something without a name.<br><br>
          
          I wonder<br>
          If another square-rooted onion,<br>
          Multiplied by this one,<br>
          Would bring back the whole<br>
          She would've put into the soup.<br>
