          Ashoka University's extended summer break provides undergraduate students with a unique temporal resource. Rather than treating this period as mere downtime, I advise students to approach it as an opportunity for structured engagement beyond the conventional academic calendar. This page outlines some avenues for productive summer engagement:

          <span class="bold-text"> summer courses:</span> Enrolling in <a href="https://www.ashoka.edu.in/summer-term-course/">Ashoka's summer term</a> is an excellent way to fulfill credit requirements.

              Completing core or elective courses in summer can free up space for advanced seminars, independent study, or internships during the academic year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Smaller Class Sizes: Summer courses often have fewer students, allowing for more interaction with professors and personalized feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flexibility for Research/Internship Prep: If you plan to apply for competitive programs (e.g., research internships, grad school), summer courses can help you build necessary prerequisites.
            </li>
          </ol>

          This summer, I plan to offer Quantitative Reasoning and Mathematical Thinking (FC-0306) and Introduction to Computer Science (CS-1102).

          <span class="bold-text"> teaching opportunities:</span> Summer can also be used to explore teaching opportunities: 

          <ol>
            <li>
              The university recruits TAs for summer courses, Young Scholars' Program, Ashoka Horizons Program, Lodha Genius Program, and Ashoka X.
            </li>
            <li>
              One can also explore globally renowned mathematics programs such as <a href="">Ross Mathematics Program (USA/China)</a> and <a href="">PROMYS (USA/India)</a>. These programs recruit undergrads with strong mathematical backgrounds as counselors or TAs.

              Teach for India stuff
