                    <b>Course Description</b>:
                    <p>
                        Symbolic logic presents an intriguing challenge in computer science: balancing the need to express complex ideas
                        with the ability to solve problems efficiently. This course explores how we can create systems that are powerful
                        enough to describe useful scenarios, yet still allow computers to reason about them effectively. We'll examine
                        various approaches to this balance, learning how theorists and practitioners have developed ways to represent
                        knowledge and automate reasoning. Without requiring any prior background in logic or advanced mathematics, this
                        course offers a gentle yet rigorous introduction to deductive systems, propositional and predicate calculi, and
                        higher-order logic. We will also learn about the applications of these formalisms to constraint solving, program
                        verification, automated reasoning, and interactive theorem proving. The objectives of this course are to: 
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Develop a foundation in the core concepts and deductive systems of propositional logic, predicate logic, and
                            higher-order logics, including their syntax, semantics, and proof techniques,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gain knowledge of the practical applications of symbolic logic in a variety of domains, such as constraint
                            solving, program verification, automated reasoning, and interactive theorem proving, 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Understand the trade-off between expressiveness and algorithmic tractability in logical formalisms, and the
                            importance of finding reasonable compromises between these conflicting goals,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Understand the fundamental limitations of formal logic, reasoning, and computation, and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Develop hands-on experience working with tools like SAT solvers and interactive theorem provers, bridging the gap between theoretical reasoning and practical considerations. <br>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                      
                    <p>
                        This course builds upon concepts such as set theory, relations, and proofs covered in Quantitative Reasoning and
                        Mathematical Thinking (FC-0306), Introduction to Computer Science (CS-1102), and Discrete Mathematics (CS-1104).
                        It also provides essential skills for analyzing and reasoning about the concepts covered in Data Structures
                        (CS-1203), Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS-1206), and Programming Language Design and Implementation
                        (CS-1319). This course serves as a foundation for advanced electives in computer science including interactive
                        theorem proving, model checking and verification, computational complexity theory, and artificial intelligence.
                        This course overlaps with Symbolic Logic (PHI-1060/CS-2160).</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Prerequisites</b>: First, the course will require a certain amount of mathematical maturity at least at the level
                    of FC-0306, and preferably at the level of CS-1102. Second, functional knowledge of a programming language (preferably
                    Python) is required for completing the assignments and projects in this course.
                </p>

                    <b>Grading</b>: A serious student of a subject is not an idle spectator to a variety show but learns best by active involvement. This is particularly true of mathematical subjects. This course is structured to incentivise involvement through the following:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Scribing: Each student will be responsible for taking detailed notes during the lectures assigned to them and
                            drafting them in LaTeX. This exercise encourages active listening and helps consolidate understanding of the
                            material. It constitutes 5% of the grade.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Course Project: Students will undertake a project on constraint solving (which requires programming). This
                            hands-on experience allows for practical application of course concepts and fosters deeper engagement with the
                            subject matter covered in Module 3. The project may be done either alone or in pairs. Project topic needs to be approved by the instructor. It carries 20% of the grade.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Assignments: The course includes 6 problem sets and 4 programming assignments. These are designed to reinforce
                            lecture material and develop practical skills in applying theoretical concepts. They constitute 30% of the grade.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Examination: Two in-class, closed-book, 1.5 hour examinations carry the remaining 45% of the grade. Students
                            are permitted to bring a single, two-sided "cheat sheet" of their own creation. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
