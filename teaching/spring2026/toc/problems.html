                    The following is a list 100 challenging practice problems. These problems are not graded, but regular submission helps you stay engaged with the material and reinforce the core concepts. You are welcome to discuss them with classmates or the teaching staff and use any resources or tools you find helpful. Their purpose is to support your learning, not evaluate it.
