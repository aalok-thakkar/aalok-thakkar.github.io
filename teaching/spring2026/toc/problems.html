                    The following is a list 100 challenging practice problems. These problems are not graded, but regular submission helps you stay engaged with the material and reinforce the core concepts. You are welcome to discuss them with classmates or the teaching staff and use any resources or tools you find helpful. Their purpose is to support your learning, not evaluate it.

                            <td>A Random Access Machine consists of a finite state machine (control unit), a finite number of registers for temporary storage, and an unbounded sequence of memory cells that can store integers. Unlike a Turing machine, which accesses memory sequentially along a tape, a RAM can directly access any memory cell in a single step, hence the term "random access." The machine operates by executing a sequence of instructions, which include arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication), data transfer between registers and memory cells, and conditional branching based on the contents of registers. Show that RAM is computationally equivalent to a deterministic Turing machine.</td>
