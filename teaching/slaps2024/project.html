                <p>
                    Course project for this semester is to apply Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)
                    solvers, covered in <a href="./lectures.html">Module 3</a>, to a domain of your choice. The project topic must be
                    approved by the instructor. The project can be completed individually or in groups of up to 3 members. Collaboration
                    with individuals from different majors or backgrounds is strongly encouraged. <br>
                    <br>
                    A project proposal is due by <b>September 28</b>. The proposal should include the chosen domain, the specific problem
                    to be solved, a brief outline of the approach, and expected outcomes. Throughout the project duration, two check-ins
                    are required via brief emails summarizing the project status, progress, and any challenges faced. The check-in dates
                    are <b>October 19</b> and <b>November 9</b>. <br>
                    <br>
                    The final submission consists of two main components: a short write-up and a poster. The write-up should summarize the 
                    approach and outcomes, including an introduction to the problem, methodology, results and analysis, and conclusions.
                    It should not exceed 5 pages. The poster should visually summarize the project, including the key problem statement,
                    main steps of the approach, significant results, and relevant visual aids. Find some guidelines and a sample
                    <a href="./../poster_guidelines.pdf">here</a>. Both of these are due by <b>November 20</b>. The class on 
                    <b>November 28</b> will be used for project presentations. This 10 to 15 minute presentation should cover an
                    introduction to the chosen domain and problem, a brief explanation of SAT/SMT solvers and how they were applied, the
                    methodology used, key results and findings, challenges faced and how they were overcome, and conclusions drawn from
                    the project. <br>
                    <br>
                    The project will be evaluated based on the originality and relevance of the chosen problem, appropriate application of
                    SAT/SMT solvers, depth of analysis, quality of results, and the clarity and effectiveness of the final submission and
                    presentation. <br>
