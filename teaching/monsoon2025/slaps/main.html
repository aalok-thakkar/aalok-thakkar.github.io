                <span class="bold-text">Course Description</span>:
                Symbolic logic presents an intriguing challenge in computer science: balancing the need to express
                complex ideas
                with the ability to solve problems efficiently. This course explores how we can create systems that are
                powerful
                enough to describe useful scenarios, yet still allow computers to reason about them effectively. We'll
                examine
                various approaches to this balance, learning how theorists and practitioners have developed ways to
                represent
                knowledge and automate reasoning. Without requiring any prior background in logic or advanced
                mathematics, this
                course offers a gentle yet rigorous introduction to deductive systems, propositional and predicate
                calculi, and
                higher-order logic. We will also learn about the applications of these formalisms to constraint solving,
                program
                verification, automated reasoning, and interactive theorem proving. The objectives of this course are
                to:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Develop a foundation in the core concepts and deductive systems of propositional logic, predicate
                    logic, and
                    higher-order logics, including their syntax, semantics, and proof techniques,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Gain knowledge of the practical applications of symbolic logic in a variety of domains, such as
                    constraint
                    solving, program verification, automated reasoning, and interactive theorem proving,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Understand the trade-off between expressiveness and algorithmic tractability in logical formalisms,
                    and the
                    importance of finding reasonable compromises between these conflicting goals,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Understand the fundamental limitations of formal logic, reasoning, and computation, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Develop hands-on experience working with tools like SAT solvers and interactive theorem provers,
                    bridging the gap between theoretical reasoning and practical considerations. <br>
                    </li>
                    </ol>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Prerequisites</span>: First, the course will require a certain amount of maturity at least at the level of [CS-2212] Data Structures and Algorithms. Second, functional knowledge of a programming language
                (preferably Python or Rust) is required for completing the assignments and projects in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Grading</span>: A serious student of a subject is not an idle spectator to a
                variety show but learns best by active
                involvement. This is particularly true of mathematical subjects. This course is structured to
                incentivise involvement through the following:

            <ol>
                    <li>
                    Assignments: The course includes four programming problem sets. These are designed to
                    reinforce
                    lecture material and develop practical skills in applying theoretical concepts. They constitute
                    <span class="bold-text">25%</span> of
                    the grade.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <a href="./project.html">Course Project</a>: Students will undertake a project on constraint solving
                    (which
                    requires programming). This hands-on experience allows for practical application of course concepts
                    and
                    fosters deeper engagement with the subject matter. The project may be done
                    either alone or
                    in pairs. Project topic needs to be approved by the instructor. It carries <span class="bold-text">25%</span> of the
                    grade.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Periodic Assessments: Six, in-class, closed-book, 45 minute quizzes carry the remaining grade.
                    </li>
                    </ol>
