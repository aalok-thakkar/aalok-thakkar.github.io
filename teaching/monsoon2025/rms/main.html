                <span class="bold-text">Course Description</span>:
                This course provides students with foundational knowledge and practical skills in research methods relevant to computer science. Students will engage with a variety of methodologies, tools, and best practices for conducting rigorous scientific research in the discipline. The course includes weekly research methods sessions led by CS faculty, where students will explore critical topics such as literature review, experimental design, data analysis, scientific writing, and ethical considerations. <br><br>
                
                In addition to these sessions, students are required to attend at least eight CS colloquium talks during the semester. These talks, delivered by invited speakers, present cutting-edge research and emerging trends in computer science, fostering a deeper understanding of current challenges and innovations in the field.
