                <span class="bold-text">Course Description</span>:
                This seminar introduces Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem, one of the most profound results in mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics. We will use <em>Gödel Without (Too Many) Tears</em> (Second Edition, 2022) by Peter Smith as our primary text, working carefully through its chapters to build a clear understanding of the proof and its significance. <br><br>
Each week, one student will be responsible for presenting the assigned chapter and leading discussion. The course will balance close reading of technical details with exploration of broader philosophical implications.
