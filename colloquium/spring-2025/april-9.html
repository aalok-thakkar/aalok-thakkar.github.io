                                        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 9, 2025</p>
                                        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM</p>
                                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> AC04-004</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Title:</strong> Algebra and co- ... in the Theory of Programming
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Abstract:</strong> The talk explores a few elementary concepts from abstract algebra that (should) inform our development of common programs and data types, but are often elided in most textbook treatments. Included are sets, monoids, boolean algebras, semirings and Kleene algebras, structure-preserving maps and homomorphisms, and notions of co-induction. The talk is intended to be accessible to a general audience.
