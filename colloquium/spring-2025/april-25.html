                                <strong>Title:</strong> AI Against Misinformation
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, I’ll share lessons from my work building AI-powered tools to counter disinformation and health misinformation across South Asia. From detecting Russian influence networks on Twitter to developing public auditing systems that supported takedowns of politically motivated harassment campaigns on Meta in Bangladesh, I’ve focused on translating global trust and safety knowledge into tools for the Global South.I want to highlight the real-world impact of this work—especially on students I’ve mentored. Two student-led teams from our AI product development program have secured commercial contracts since March 2024. Alumni have gone on to join Google (US), intern at CERN, and pursue graduate programs at CMU and Columbia. Our health literacy tool, Sakhi, is live with families in rural India and Bangladesh, and both Sakhi and our disinformation tracking platform Arbiter are being incubated at UNICEF Tech Ventures.
