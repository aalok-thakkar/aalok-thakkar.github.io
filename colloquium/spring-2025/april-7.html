                                <strong>Title:</strong> Reliable Prediction and Explanation in Deep Learning

                                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning models have achieved or surpassed human-level performance on various vision tasks but we would like them to be reliable too. For example, we want generalization to unseen inputs and robust, explainable model predictions. In this talk, I will present some of my recent work on these topics. First, we will see a trade-off between robustness to natural transformations and robustness to adversarial pixel-wise perturbations, and a curriculum learning-based algorithm to achieve both (NeurIPS 2021). Then we will see how to construct sample efficient universal adversarial perturbations (UAP) from known adversarial attacks (Best paper, CODS-COMAD 2022). Next, we will revisit attribution methods and their robustness to adversarial attacks using simple properties like locality and diversity (AAAI 2024), and finally we will apply adversarial perturbations to recover drift of old class prototypes in continual learning (CVPR 2024).
