          I am interested in formal methods and logic, and their applications to
          programming languages and artificial intelligence.

          <b> program synthesis:</b> Instead of writing a program directly, it
          is often easier to describe the intended behavior of a program in
          terms of either formal specification, natural language description, or
          input-output examples. Can we then translate these descriptions to
          program implementations? My prior work addresses this question in the
          context of synthesizing relational queries from input-output examples
          by developing the example-guided synthesis paradigm. A good starting
          point for this work is

          I am currently interested in extending example-guided synthesis to
          more expressive queries and other language domains as well as the
          combination synthesis problem where the goal is to fulfill more than 
          one formal specification simultaneously. <br />

          <b> reasoning in AI:</b> AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
          requires robust reasoning capabilities and cannot solely rely on
          language generation methods. While current models excel at pattern
          recognition and text generation, they struggle with logical
          consistency and factual accuracy over longer contexts. On the other
          hand, symbolic reasoning excels at maintaining consistency and
          following strict rules, but struggles with the flexibility,
          creativity, and natural language understanding that neural networks
          provide. To leverage the best of both approaches, this line of work
          focuses on embedding formal reasoning tools within Large Language
          Models (LLMs). This integration aims to combine the strengths of
          data-driven language generation with logical inference, potentially
          leading to AI systems that can produce text that is not only fluent
          and contextually appropriate, but also logically sound and factually
          accurate across extended reasoning chains. <br />
          <br />
          <b> reasoning about AI:</b> While traditional AI development focuses 
          on functional correctness—ensuring that systems perform as 
          intended—this project extends to providing guarantees in areas such 
          as robustness, fairness, and data privacy, particularly in the context
          of large language models (LLMs) and broader AI technologies. Robustness
          guarantees that the system's output is reliable in the face of 
          adversarial or unexpected inputs, fairness ensures that the model dees
          not perpetuate or amplify biases, and data privacy safeguards sensitive 
          information and protects user data.
