					I am interested in formal methods and logic, and their applications to programming languages and artificial
					intelligence.

					<b> program synthesis:</b> Instead of writing a program directly, it is often easier to describe the intended behavior
					of a program in terms of either formal specification, natural language description, or input-output examples. Can we
					then translate these descriptions to program implementations? My prior work addresses this question in the context of 
					synthesizing relational queries from input-output examples by developing the example-guided synthesis paradigm. A
					good starting point for this work is <a href="./webpage_files/publications/thesis/thesis.pdf">my PhD thesis</a> or
					<a href="./webpage_files/publications/conference/pldi2021/pldi2021.pdf">EGS (PLDI 2021).</a> I am currently
					interested in extending example-guided synthesis to more expressive queries and other language domains. <br>
					<br>
					<b> text generation:</b> In this direction, the first line of work focuses on integrating automated reasoning into
					text generation, facilitating interaction between generative AI models and constraint solvers. This approach aims to
					produce more logically consistent and factually accurate text by leveraging the strengths of both systems. The second
					area of research investigates constrained text generation for domain specific applications. This involves developing
					techniques to generate text that adheres to specific syntactic and semantic rules, formats, or requirements. Both
					these research directions seek to improve the reliability, precision, and domain-specific applicability of
					AI-generated text. <br>
					<br>
					<b> automated verification:</b> I am also interested in automated verification of three critical Indian systems: UPI
					(Unified Payments Interface), EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines), and Aadhaar (the national biometric ID system). The
					goal is to develop formal methods and tools to rigorously verify the correctness, security, and privacy properties of
					these systems to enhance public trust, identify potential vulnerabilities, and contribute to the overall reliability of
					India's digital infrastructure.
